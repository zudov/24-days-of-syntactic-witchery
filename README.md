# 24 days of syntactic witchery
*aligning characters for fun and profit, with Haskell and PureScript*

## Day 1 — Prelude <a name="day-1"></a>
In this "24 days of…" I want to focus on tricks and patterns that are (at least to some extent):

- expressed using a relatively simple machinery
- capture some idea in a concise, but not necessarily intuitive way
- non-obvious, but can be discovered by accident or when striked with a bright idea
- neat in their own way
- mostly ungooglable

Some of these are widely used in every other codebase, other pop up occasionally in the dark corners. Some are charming, but when used inappropriately can seed confusion and havoc.

Even though the title says "syntactic", I'll steer away from talking about plain usage of syntactic sugar and GHC's syntactic extensions since they are already very well documented in [GHC User's Guide][ghc-syntactic-extensions] and excellent [24 Days of GHC Extensions][24-days-of-ghc-extensions].

Real witches do not rely on syntactic sugar, they cast thunderstorms of funny operators instead.

Obviously it's a work in progress. I don't yet have a full list of things to write about, which means that the topics won't be ordered very meaningfully. I might start running out of good ideas soon, and would have to [pick up `lens`](https://ro-che.info/ccc/23).

Guest posts are very welcome, and don't have to be in Haskell/PureScript as long as they fit the idea.

## Day 2 — `[ a | cond ]` <a name="day-2"></a>

This simple spell allows to conditionally construct an empty or single-element list:

```haskell
λ> [ 42 | True ]
[42]
λ> [ 42 | False ]
[]
```

It uses a small subset of the [list comprehension] syntactic sugar.

[list comprehension]: https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension

Is there any use for it? Bundled with `concat` it provides a nice way of constructing
lists where particular elements should be included only if a set of conditions is satisfied:

```haskell
λ> concat [ [ "foo" | True ], [ "bar" | True, False ], [ "baz" | True ] ]
["foo","baz"]
```

But what's that good for?

Let's say you want to conditionally add several css classes to an html element (uses [lucid]):

[lucid]: https://github.com/chrisdone/lucid

```haskell
import Lucid

todoHtml :: Todo -> Html ()
todoHtml todo =
  div_
    [ classes_ $ concat
        [ [ "todo" ]
        , [ "completed" | isCompleted todo ]
        , [ "active"    | isActive todo ]
        , [ "urgent"    | isActive todo, deadlineSoon   todo ]
        , [ "wasted"    | isActive todo, deadlineMissed todo ]
        ]
    ]
    (todoTitle todo)
```

Or you want to list yourself out of boring interview questions:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = mapM_ (putStrLn . fizzbuzz) [1..100]
  where
    fizzbuzz n = concat (fizz ++ buzz ++ num)
      where
        fizz = [ "Fizz" | n `mod` 3 == 0 ]
        buzz = [ "Buzz" | n `mod` 5 == 0 ]
        num  = [ show n | null fizz, null buzz ]
```

As any proper spell this one might be confusing and non-obvious for someone who haven't encountered it before. But when used wisely it provides a good structure and easy to grasp code-pattern which justifies it.

There are many more crazy things that one can do with Haskell's list comprehensions, you can read more about them [here](https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/guest-posts/2014-12-07-list-comprehensions.html). PureScript, on the other hand, choses to not have list comprehension sugar.

In the next section I'll show another pattern that relies on a funky operator and allows to express the same idea in a more generic way.

## Day 3 — `a <$ fb` <a name="day-3"></a>

The `<$` operator is provided by both [Haskell's][haskell <$] and [PureScript's][purescript <$] Preludes:

[haskell <$]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:-60--36-
[purescript <$]: https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/3.1.0/docs/Data.Functor#v:(%3C$)

```haskell
(<$) :: Functor f => a -> f b -> f a
```

The idea is that it takes an `f b` and replaces all the `b` values in it with the `a` that was given to it, resulting in `f a`.

It can be easily defined in terms of `<$>` (aka `fmap`):

```haskell
a <$ fb = const a <$> fb
```

And used for all of your favourite functors:

```haskell
λ> 42 <$ [1, 2, 3]
[42,42,42]
λ> 42 <$ Just 0
Just 42
λ> 42 <$ Nothing
Nothing
λ> 42 <$ Right 0
Right 42
λ> 42 <$ Left "come 40 million years later"
Left "come 40 million years later"
λ> 42 <$ putStrLn "Computing the ultimate answer"
Computing the ultimate answer
42
```

Until today (when I finally read the docstring) my misintuition about `<$` has been something like "evaluates the stuff on the right side, throws away the result and returns the value on the left side".

It's handy for returning the value while logging the act of returning it:

```haskell
gift <$ putStrLn "HERE'S YOUR GIFT, BOY. HO! HO! HO!"
```

You can also combine it with `do-notation` thus avoiding the `pure`/`return` in the ond of it:

```haskell
-- | Gets reindeer ready for action.
initReindeer :: IO ReindeerStatus
initReindeer = ReindeerReady <$ do
  putStrLn "Attach the sledges"
  putStrLn "Turn the bells on"
  putStrLn "Open the stable doors"
```

I find this particularly handy when implementing ["eval" functions for `purescript-halogen`][halogen-eval]:

[halogen-eval]: https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/blob/master/docs/2%20-%20Defining%20a%20component.md#evaluating-actions

```haskell
Toggle next -> next <$ do
  state <- H.get
  let nextState = not state
  H.put nextState
  H.raise $ Toggled nextState
```

Combined with `guard`, we can replicate the success of [`[ a | cond ]`](#day-2) with no sugar:

```haskell
-- | Returns a gift for a given kid (if they deserve it).
giftFor :: Kid -> Maybe Gift
giftFor kid =
  requestedGift kid <$ guard (isGoodKid kid)
```

Note that the above expression in the body of this function can return a list, `Maybe`, `IO` (throws an exception for bad kids), or any other type that implements the `Alternative`.

One could achieve the same generality using [`[ a | cond ]`](#day-2) and enabling `MonadComprehensions` extension, but I'll leave that to muggles.
